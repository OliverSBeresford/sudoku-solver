define function find: parameters: endIndex
  loop over flattened grid with index and value:
    if value is equal to 0:
      repeat [increment i] until i is 9 starting at 1:
        make current square's value i.
        if i fits into the sudoku:
          if current square in sudoku (grid) is the last empty square in the sudoku:
            return True
          if not:
            if run find with same for endIndex returns False:
              continue with repeat until i is 9 loop
          break out of repeat until i is 9 loop
      if repeat until i is 10 loop made it to the end without breaking:
        current square becomes empty again
        return False
